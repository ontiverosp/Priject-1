# Priject-1

Created a cocktail ingredient search app where you can look for cocktails that match the ingredients you have on-hand. We also created a beer selection based on region and type using a separate beer API.

The objective for this app is to provide a quick lookup service for anyone not knowing what alcohol to make and to serve them easy-to-follow instructions for making a drink.
